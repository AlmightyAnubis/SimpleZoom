# Simple Zoom
Allows you to zoom in like in optifine. Many other mods cause issues with rubidium and similar mods. This mod tries to prevent that.

Zoom in with the C-Key by default (can be changed in the Keybinds).

While Zoomed in you can adjust the zoom with the mouse wheel. Extrem zoom out and in may cause some graphic glitches.
